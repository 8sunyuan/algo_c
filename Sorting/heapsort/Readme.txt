heapsort.c --- is based on Priority Queue or Heap implementation with an array, not tree node link pointers.
The idea is from "Algorithms in C".

To compile:

    -> make clean
    -> make

To compile C++ program file:

    -> make -f Makefile++
    -> make clean -f Makefile++
     or in this case, both makefile and Makefile++ will do the same clean actions.

    -> make clean
